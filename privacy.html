        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>SkyReady ("we," "our," or "the app") is developed by Tim Dalton Software. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the SkyReady mobile application.</p>
        <p>We believe in simplicity and transparency. SkyReady is designed to provide weather information and clothing recommendations with minimal data collection. We do not sell your data or serve ads.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>Location Data</h3>
        <p>SkyReady requests access to your device location to provide weather forecasts and clothing recommendations for your current area. Specifically:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Type of location data:</strong> Approximate geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) obtained from your device's location services.</li>
            <li><strong>When collected:</strong> Only when you actively use the app or when a scheduled notification needs to fetch weather data for your location.</li>
            <li><strong>How used:</strong> Your location is sent to Apple WeatherKit to retrieve weather forecast data. The location is used solely to request weather information relevant to your geographic area.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Your location data is stored locally on your device for the purpose of displaying weather information and sharing data with app extensions (widgets and notification service). Location data is not transmitted to any server owned or operated by us.</li>
            <li><strong>Retention:</strong> Location data is overwritten each time the app fetches new weather data. No historical location data is retained.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Weather Data</h3>
        <p>Weather forecast data retrieved from Apple WeatherKit is stored locally on your device to display current conditions, forecasts, and recommendations. This data is refreshed when you open the app or pull to refresh, and when scheduled notifications are delivered.</p>

        <h3>Notification Preferences</h3>
        <p>If you enable morning weather notifications, your selected notification time is stored locally on your device. This preference is used solely to schedule local notifications and is not transmitted to any external server.</p>

        <h3>Subscription Status</h3>
        <p>If you subscribe to SkyReady+, your subscription status is managed entirely by Apple through StoreKit. We do not collect, store, or have access to your payment information, Apple ID, or billing details. We only check your subscription entitlement status through Apple's StoreKit framework to determine which features to unlock.</p>

        <h3>Analytics Data</h3>
        <p>SkyReady uses <strong>Mixpanel</strong>, a third-party analytics service, to help us understand how the app is used and improve the experience. Mixpanel collects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>App usage events:</strong> Screen views, feature usage (e.g., which themes are selected, whether notifications are set up), weather load times, and subscription-related events (paywall views, purchase completions).</li>
            <li><strong>Device information:</strong> App version, build number, iOS version, and device model (e.g., "iPhone"). This is attached to every event as context.</li>
            <li><strong>Anonymous identifier:</strong> Mixpanel assigns a random device identifier to distinguish unique users. This is not your Apple ID, name, email, or any personally identifiable information.</li>
            <li><strong>Location names:</strong> When weather loads, the city or locality name (e.g., "London") is sent as an event property. Your precise GPS coordinates are <strong>not</strong> sent to Mixpanel.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Analytics data is sent to Mixpanel's EU data center (<code>api-eu.mixpanel.com</code>). Mixpanel's privacy practices are described in their privacy policy at <a href="https://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy/" rel="noopener">mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy</a>.</p>
        <p>We use analytics data solely to understand usage patterns, fix bugs, and improve the app. We do not use analytics data for advertising or sell it to third parties.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>SkyReady does <strong>not</strong> collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your name, email address, or any personal identifiers</li>
            <li>Advertising identifiers (IDFA)</li>
            <li>Browsing history or activity outside the app</li>
            <li>Contacts, photos, or any other device data</li>
            <li>Health or fitness data</li>
            <li>Financial or payment information</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

        <h3>Apple WeatherKit</h3>
        <p>SkyReady uses Apple WeatherKit to retrieve weather forecast data. When the app requests weather data, your approximate location (latitude and longitude) is sent to Apple's WeatherKit API. Apple's use of this data is governed by <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/" rel="noopener">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h3>Mixpanel</h3>
        <p>SkyReady uses Mixpanel for product analytics as described in the "Analytics Data" section above. Mixpanel processes data in the European Union. See <a href="https://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy/" rel="noopener">Mixpanel's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, rent, or transfer your personal data to any third party for marketing purposes. Data is shared only with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Apple WeatherKit:</strong> Your location coordinates, to retrieve weather forecasts.</li>
            <li><strong>Mixpanel:</strong> Anonymous usage events and device metadata, to help us improve the app.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>All personal data collected by SkyReady is stored locally on your device using standard iOS storage mechanisms (UserDefaults and App Groups shared containers). Analytics data is processed by Mixpanel on their EU servers. Your data is protected by the security measures built into iOS, including device encryption.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>SkyReady does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. The app does not require account creation and collects no personal identifiers. The app is rated 4+ and is suitable for all ages.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>

        <h3>Location Access</h3>
        <p>You can revoke location access at any time through your device Settings (Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Location Services &gt; SkyReady). If you revoke location access, the app will not be able to provide weather data for your current location.</p>

        <h3>Notifications</h3>
        <p>You can disable notifications at any time through your device Settings (Settings &gt; Notifications &gt; SkyReady) or within the app's Settings screen.</p>

        <h3>Analytics</h3>
        <p>Mixpanel respects the iOS "Ask App Not to Track" (App Tracking Transparency) setting. SkyReady does not use the IDFA or track you across other apps.</p>

        <h3>Data Deletion</h3>
        <p>Because all personal data is stored locally on your device, deleting the SkyReady app removes all associated data. For analytics data held by Mixpanel, you may contact us and we will submit a deletion request on your behalf.</p>

        <h3>European Economic Area (GDPR) Rights</h3>
        <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area, you have the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict processing of, and port your personal data, and to object to processing. Because SkyReady stores personal data locally on your device and does not maintain server-side user records, most of these rights are satisfied by default. Deleting the app removes all local data. For Mixpanel-held analytics data, contact us at the address below.</p>

        <h3>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) Rights</h3>
        <p>If you are a California resident, you have the right to know what personal information is collected, request deletion, and opt out of the sale of personal information. SkyReady does not sell personal information. We do not share personal information for cross-context behavioural advertising.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

        <hr>
